This is a collection of documentation, schematics and CAD files for a DIY guitar
effects pedal that tries to emulate the three main categories of guitar distortion
effects (overdrive, distortion and fuzz) with one simple circuit and set of controls.

The circuit also implements togglable waveform clipping mode and an auxiliary gain
stage, allowing the user to dial in extreme fuzz tones.

## Controls

### Knobs

* TONE: Input high pass filtering;
* GAIN: Main stage amplification;
* VOLUME: Output volume;

### Switches

* 'DIODE': Waveform clipping type (symmetrical vs asymmetrical);
* BOOST: Enables/disables the auxiliary gain stage;

schematic by Gary Burchett (with ideas by Tim Escobedo, Jack Orman, Joe Gagan and
others).
