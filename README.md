# Overdrive/Distortion/Fuzz Pedal

Shield: [![CC BY-NC-SA 4.0][cc-by-nc-sa-shield]][cc-by-nc-sa]

This is a collection of documentation, schematics and CAD files for a DIY guitar
effects pedal that tries to emulate the typical sound of the three main categories
of guitar distortion effects (overdrive, distortion and fuzz) with one relatively
simple circuit and set of controls.

The circuit also implements togglable waveform clipping mode and an auxillary gain
stage, allowing the user to dial in extremely dirty fuzz tones.

## Controls

### Knobs

* TONE: Input high pass filtering;
* GAIN: Main stage amplification;
* VOLUME: Output volume;

### Switches

* 'DIODE': Waveform clipping type (simmetrical vs asymmetrical);
* BOOST: Enables/disables the auxillary gain stage;

others).
